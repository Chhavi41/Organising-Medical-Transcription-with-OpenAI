# Organising Medical Transcription with OpenAI

This project processes unstructured **medical transcriptions** and extracts structured patient information such as **Age**, **Recommended Treatment/Procedure**, **Medical Specialty**, and **ICD Codes** using **OpenAI Function Calling**.  

The aim is to automatically organise medical data into a clean DataFrame for further use in healthcare workflows.
